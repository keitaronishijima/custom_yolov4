# Customized YOLO version 4 to detect emergency vehicles and objects

## Description

Our project was motivated by the increasing demands in self-driving cars and technologies that support their functionalities. Since the current yolov4 algorithms only encapsulates general vehicle categories such as cars and trucks, we thought adding more vehicle categories would help traffic become more efficient and optimized. We recycled the existing yolov4 algorithm so we can not only detect general cars but also detect emergency cars such as ambulance. We implemented our program by training a neural network on different types of cars, and inserted the trained network after the original yolov4 neural network. This allows the program to fine classify the categories of cars.
